Prot16 themes for RXVT-Unicode (URXVT)
======================================

Copy the contents of your preferred theme to your `~/.Xresources`.

Alternatively, rename the theme file into [new-name].Xcolors and source it from the `.Xresources` using the following syntax:

```sh
#include </full/path/to/file.Xcolors>
```

For a working example, refer to my [dotfiles](https://github.com/protesilaos/dotfiles)
